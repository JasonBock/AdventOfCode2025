# Advent of Code 2025 Notes

These are my notes for each day's solutions, if I had any.

## Current Plan

Just keep swimming...

# Day 1

## Part 1

`255` - That's too low.

Oops, need to account for numbers larger than 99.

## Part 2
`5043` - too low
`6127` - still too low
`6133` - yay!

98, R5 => 103, which is actually 3, and I would've crossed 0
